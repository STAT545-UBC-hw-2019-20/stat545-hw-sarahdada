# *This file is for the Homework 3 for the stat545 course.* 
_This file_ contains the final versions of HW03.

Unfortunately, I am unable to knit. I have brought it up with the TAs, and am trying to deal with it. Here is my current link: https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20/stat545-hw-sarahdada/tree/master/HW03 

I completed the following tasks:
1.Task Two: the minimum and maximum GDP per capita for all continents.
2.Task Five: Life expectancy changes over time by continent.
3.Task Three: Spread within the continents.

Hope you're well!
Sarah
