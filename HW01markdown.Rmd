#I'm going to summarize a little bit about mtcars for you. Mt cars has speed and distance. It shows a min, max, median, mean, and the 1st and 3rd quarter's speed and distance.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
names(mtcars)
```
#When I use names, I can see the many variables of information available about mtcars.
