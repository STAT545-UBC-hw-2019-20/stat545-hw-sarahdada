I'm going to summarize a little bit about mtcars for you. Mtcars has data that was exctracted from the 1974 Motor trend US magazine (citation:R documentation). Mtcars has speed and distance. It shows a min, max, median, mean, and the 1st and 3rd quarter's speed and distance.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
names(mtcars)
```
When I use names, I can see the many variables of information available about mtcars. 
```
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```
We can also see that the top cars on the list available with these variables, including Mazda RX4, and Datsun710.
```{r}
tail(mtcars)
```
*Finally*, we see that there is infomation about cars at the end of the list, including Porche 914-2, Lotus Europa, and Ford Pantera.
