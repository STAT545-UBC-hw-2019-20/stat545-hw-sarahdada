```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```
I filtered so that if there was information in Afghanistan, Vietnam, or Cambodia, within the years 1970 and 1979, that information would be filtered into the dataframe named 'gapminder1.1'.
```{r}
gapminder1.1 <- gapminder %>% 
  dplyr::filter(country == 'Afghanistan'| country =='Vietnam' | country == 'Cambodia' && year == 1970:1979)
```
