Remarks:

-Your read me is having a really tough time- you might want to figure out why it is spewing words.
-I really liked your commentary, it is personable, efficient, and clear. This is great and efficient code as well.
-I have never seen some of these themes and legend titles (element blank) and it's cool to know that they exist. I also like tally, and your use of geom bar
-Maybe you could do colors or transparency in your graphs.
-You can change the size of the physical graph, in addition to the scale.
