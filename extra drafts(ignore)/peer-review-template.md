Remarks:

-Nice job getting the html link to work. I just wrote needs work, because I think a little more detail on your code choice would be great.
-Your graphs are really great for what we had learned!
-I learned how to use round, and I was looking for a similar instruction earlier today! Also I had never seen the use of slice.
-Nice use of simple blocks of code, I think that maybe you could have put some chunks of code together to make it more cohesive.
-I used lag a little differently, naming what I used as a new term and then subtracting years by subtracting current minus lag. Might have worked for you!
