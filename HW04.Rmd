```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```

count(wt_vars=words) means if there is an option, what 
left is the first seperation, right of dash is the next seperation.- here that is part, dimension, seperated by an underscore.


I am going to pivor wider, and aim to have country on left of dash, and lifeExp on right of dash, per year. 


```{r}
gapminder2<-gapminder%>%
  select(year,country,lifeExp)%>%
  dplyr::filter(country=="Canada"|country=="Afghanastan")

gapminder2

gapminder2 %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols     = c(-year),
              names_from  = c(country, lifeExp), 
              names_sep   = "_", 
              values_from = Yearsliving)



```
