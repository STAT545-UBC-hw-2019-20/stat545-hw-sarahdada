# *This file is for the STAT545 UBC **statistics** course.* 
_This file_ allows me to submit my homework assignments for marks. I have tagged the most recent versions, and I have named the items with relevance, such as HW01Iso, or HW01markdown. 

## Now, I am going to tell you a little bit about myself. \*Laughs uncertainly\*
  
I am a graduate student in the faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
I used to work in cancer; now I work in autism.
I swear, I still enjoy vaccines.
**Honestly.**

*Finally*, I would like you to know that I am representing the east coast.
### I'm from Prince Edward Island.
We are known for our potatoes and lobsters, and the play **Anne of Green Gables**. I came here for the mountains and the ocean, I have made many friends, and this feels like home.
